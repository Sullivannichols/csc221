# KJV Bible Search API 
# What it is, and what it does?  The program is a bible search program that  the user can search for important key words, and can also tell you what book number it is in.  Also the person can type, and save bible verse on the program.
# Who will use it?  Anybody can use  the program, but its for people who want to share the information to other program users.
# Why it's worth building? The program is worth building because it will help people save important information, and will highlight text they already read, so they can read the whole bible without rereading text. The program will remind the user about last text read.

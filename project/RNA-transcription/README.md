RNA Transcription

Both DNA and RNA strands are a sequence of nucleotides.

The four nucleotides found in DNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T).

The four nucleotides found in RNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and uracil (U).

Given a DNA strand, its transcribed RNA strand is formed by replacing each nucleotide with its complement:

G -> C
C -> G
T -> A
A -> U
Implement a function to_rna(dna) that takes one parameter, dna (a string), and returns its RNA complement (per RNA transcription) as a string.

The function shall meet these conditions:

to_rna should be able to handle DNA nucleotides in either upper or lowercase form and return them in the same form they were given
to_rna should also be robust to whitespace, preserving whatever whitespace contained in the dna parameter
A complete set of unit tests for this function shall be included, using both the unittest and doctest modules.

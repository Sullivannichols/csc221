RNA Nucleotide Count

Implement a function rna_count(dna) that takes one parameter, dna (a string), and returns a dictionary with the RNA nucleotides ('A', 'C', 'G', and 'U') as keys and the number of occurances of each nucleotide as the the value, after transcribing the original DNA strand to its RNA complement.

The function shall meet these conditions:

rna_count should be able to handle DNA strings in either upper or lowercase form and return the dictionary with uppercase keys
rna_count should also be robust to whitespace, ignoring it
A complete set of unit tests for this function shall be included, using both the unittest and doctest modules.
